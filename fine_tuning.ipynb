    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through how to fine-tune a pre-trained large language model with domain specific knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The domain specific dataset that we will be using to fine-tune this model will be United Kingdom (U.K.) Supreme Court case documents. We will tune the model on roughly 693 legal documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset info\n",
    "* <strong>Page count:</strong> ~17,718\n",
    "* <strong>Word count:</strong> 10,015,333\n",
    "* <strong>Characters (no spaces):</strong> 49,897,639\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire dataset is publically available and can be download [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7152317#.ZCSfaoTMI2y)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations when fine-tuning the model\n",
    "The notebook has been configured to allow you to only use a subset of the entire dataset to fine-tune the model if you would like. There is a variable named _**doc_count**_ in the _**Data Prep**_ section. You can set this number to whatever you would like and it will only fine-tune the model based on the number of documents you set this variable to. The smaller this value the faster the model will fine-tune.\n",

    "## Training/Tuning Time estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the estimated training times based on total number of case documents in the training dataset.\n",

    "Steps you will go through in the notebook to test the base model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone this repo in a SageMaker Studio Jupyter notebook\n",
    "2. Install needed notebook libraries\n",
    "3. Configure the notebook to use SageMaker\n",

    "5. Deploy the model inference endpoint\n",
    "6. Call inference endpoint to retrieve results from the LLM\n",

    "1. Download dataset\n",
    "2. Prep the dataset and upload it to S3\n",

    "4. Set hyperparameters for fine-tuning\n",
    "5. Start training/tuning job\n",
    "6. Deploy inference endpoint for the fine-tuned model\n",
    "7. Call inference endpoint for the fine-tuned model\n",

      "The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 created a system of parallel legal proceedings for civil and family cases, which many thought incompatible with the principle of a single trial.^[1](#FN1){ref-types]^A significant consequence was the extension of the time limits within which civil cases had to be concluded.By contrast, the Family Proceedings Act was intended to apply to the family court, and in particular to deal with family law matters such as the maintenance of children, and the disposal of the family home.It created a system of summary, and frequently accelerated, family court proceedings, which was designed to avoid what the law officers regarded as the unsatisfactory consequences of the parallel system.^[2](#FN2){ref-types]^It was a system which enabled parties to focus on the issues and the evidence.In time, it proved so effective that, at least in England and Wales, the system came to be seen as the only way to resolve family law cases expeditiously and without the negative features of the parallel system.As a result, the time limits imposed by the Matrimonial Causes Act for civil cases were extended to family proceedings.^[3](#FN3){ref-types]^There are, however, important differences between the two sets of time limits.Under the Matrimonial Causes Act, a party has 3 years from the date on which the cause of action arose to make an application for a writ of right, which may be followed by a full trial, unless the court allows the time to be extended for a period not exceeding one year.A judgment of absolute divorce can be obtained after six years.By contrast, a party to an accelerated family court case has five years from the date on which the proceedings were issued to make an application, and this period may be extended by a court order for up to a further five years.In other words, a party to an accelerated family court case can take legal action in respect of the matters which are the subject of the proceedings, and obtain a final judgment, up to 15 years after the date on which the proceedings were issued.These differences may have consequences for the person whose case has been accelerated.For example, the 15 year period means that the person may be an adult, and living independently, at the time\n",

      "tell me about the Ellenborough Park [1956] case: [19] it was a claim for damages arising out of a collision between the plaintiff's motor car and a van. The claim was based on the allegation that the driver of the van was grossly intoxicated at the time of the collision. It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the driver of the van was an agent of the defendants within the meaning of section 2(3)(b) of the Liquor Licensing Act 1997. The defendants objected on the grounds that the driver was not an agent in relation to the alleged breach of the statutory duty and also that the action was not one of which a court of competent jurisdiction could have taken cognisance. On the agency issue, Gray LJ (with whom the other members of the court agreed) held that the driver of the van was not an agent of the defendants within the meaning of section 2(3)(b) of the 1997 Act. He was not a servant in the technical sense, nor a partner, joint venturer or other associate, and he did not perform services for the defendants under a contract or agreement. However, he was an agent in the wider sense, namely, one who acted on behalf of the defendants, and that was enough to bring him within section 2(3)(b). The action was one of which a court of competent jurisdiction could have taken cognisance, and Gray LJ held that it was.I am in general agreement with Gray LJ's reasoning on this aspect of the case.But I do not think that the same can be said of the present case.It seems to me that the driver of the minicab was not a party to the contract between the company operating the minicabs and the minicab owner, nor was he in a position to suffer or give damages as a result of the alleged breach of the contract by the company.If the company had failed to provide a properly licensed minicab, it is hard to see what legal remedy the minicab owner would have against the driver.Although the minicab owner was said to be a co party to the contract with the minicab company, this in my view merely reflected the fact that the minicab owner was a shareholder in the minicab company and, as such, entitled to be a party to the contract.In my view, the driver was not an agent of the minicab company within the meaning of section\n",
